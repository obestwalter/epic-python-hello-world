# Self Referential Epic Hello World Creator

**Todo turn this into an epic cement boss template**

To get right into the self referentiality: [here is a link to the page where this file is hosted](https://github.com/obestwalter/linpy3toolchain)
* Writing a python script is easy 
* ... the rest not so much

This project explores the most sophisticated (linux centric) toolchain to create an Epic Hello World (TM) using everything the vast Python ecsosystem has to offer. The phrase 'Best Practices' comes to mind, but you won't here it from me ;) ... with an extra emphasis of keeping it DRY.

This is a completely opinionated approach based on my personal preferences without any comparison to stuff I don't use. I am aware that a lot of my choices might be completely arbitrary and due to ignorance of better options. Anyway, that's how I roll at the moment and if you want to shoot me a note, that tool/approach <your thingy here> is better than mine I will be delighted to hear from you why.

# General stuff

## Boilerplate

I hate Boilerplate! Python itself is pretty lean, but still a lot of Boilerplate is 
necessary to whip a project into shape and automate all the tedious bits.

## MVC 

* universal architecture pattern suitable for a lot of applications

## Potential slide hosters/tools
