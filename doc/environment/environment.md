# Environment

## Aims
* isolate environments of different projets with different dependencies
    * + system Python can be left alone (less chance to screw your system up)
    * + different versions of the same lib can be used in parallel
    * - Technical overhead to get set up
    * - Mental overhead switching between projects
    
* downside if virtualenv: missing system package dependencies

## Windows

**Caveat** I do all my development (in fact all non development as well (including gaming :)) on Linux and try to avoid Windows like the balck plague - so i might not be the most helpful resource in this area ...
